## About <a name = "about"></a>

ChatGPT Detector is a project focused on creating a robust system for identifying and detecting instances of ChatGPT-generated text. In a world where AI language models are extensively used, it becomes imperative to have tools that can differentiate between content produced by humans and content generated by AI. This project offers a practical solution to empower users in verifying the authenticity of text and combatting the spread of misinformation and deceptive information propagated by AI language models.

Notably, the primary emphasis of this project lies in presenting an end-to-end machine learning design rather than solely prioritizing model performance. By providing comprehensive guidelines and suggestions, the project aims to equip developers and researchers with the knowledge and tools needed to build similar systems effectively. The focus is on delivering a well-structured and efficient machine learning pipeline to address the specific challenge of detecting ChatGPT-generated content, promoting transparency, and encouraging further research in the field.
